# MEDIA KEYBIND

A simple media keybind script I am creating for use with keyboards that lack proper media keys. If you user AutoHotKey to bind buttons, this may be a good alternative for you. In my case, I use AutoHotKey to bind the PB button on my 60% keyboard to be a media key that can play/pause videos, music etc. Since I tend to watch YouTube videos or listen to music while I'm playing video games, I've run into an issue. Most anti-cheats these days will prevent certain games from launching if AutoHotKey is running. In my case, I cannot play Battlefield or The Finals if I'm running AutoHotKey. Sometimes I want to play games casually and enjoy background music or watch videos on the side. To solve this issue, I am creating this simple Python script to test with these games and attempt to have my media key binding without interfering with anti-cheat in games.

## DISCLAIMER
This, like most of my projects, is open source. You can download it and use it as you like. All I ask is that you DO NOT modify this script to behave as a macro for cheating in games. Obviously, if you wanted to do that you'd have figured it out already.
